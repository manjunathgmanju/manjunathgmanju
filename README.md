ðŸ‘‹ Hello, World! I am Manjunath, an avid data scientist from Bangalore. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸš€ I love building Machine Learning projects that make a difference. Whether it's coding, designing, or experimenting with new technologies, I'm always eager to learn and innovate.

ðŸ’» Currently, I'm focusing on Computer Vision for Object Detection and Recognition, Path Planning and Trajectory Generation. I believe in the power of collaboration and open-source, so feel free to explore my repositories and contribute if you share similar interests.

ðŸŒ± Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking and camping, immersing myself in nature's beauty and serenity,I find solace and creativity in the art of cooking. I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance to stay creative and inspired.
